Thank you for installing the MeldCompare package.

Instructions for Use
====================

As you move around and work, the plugin remembers the to most recent active files
or tabs. When activated, it loads those two files into BeyondCompare for you.

After making any merge changes in the application, save and close your files. You
should then receive a message to reload the files in the editor.

Use the keyboard shortcut [Ctrl-Opt-D] to launch BeyondCompare.

Use the menu item under Tools or the menu item under the
right-click context menu.
